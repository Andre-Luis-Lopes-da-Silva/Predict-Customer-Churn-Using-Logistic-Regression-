# Predict-Customer-Churn-Using-Logistic-Regression-
Churn prediction means detecting which customers are likely to leave a service or to cancel a subscription to a service. 

It is a critical prediction for many businesses because acquiring new clients often costs more than retaining existing ones. Once you can identify those customers that are at risk of cancelling, you should know exactly what marketing action to take for each individual customer to maximise the chances that the customer will remain.

Customer churn is a common problem across businesses in many sectors. If you want to grow as a company, you have to invest in acquiring new clients. Every time a client leaves, it represents a significant investment lost. Both time and effort need to be channelled into replacing them. Being able to predict when a client is likely to leave, and offer them incentives to stay, can offer huge savings to a business.

This notebook describes a churn prediction using logistic regression, that is a type of machine learning algorithm.
